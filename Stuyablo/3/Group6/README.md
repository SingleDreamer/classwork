Period 3, Group 6

Sydney Caputo, Eric Kolbusz, Rushil Kumar, Mary Taft

Characters:
Each character will have health, dexterity, strength, and intelligence. These will all start at 8. For the PC, the person will have 8 points to distribute as they may amongst the different attributes. For the NPC, these 8 points will be distributed randomly.

We have one Ogre NPC, one Warrior PC, and (Eric and Rushil, add what you have).

Certain characters will have specific attributes to that type (e.g. wizard and mana) that will help differentiate them.  Also, certain characters will have particular attributes boosted more than normal (e.g. warriors and strength).


Combat System:
The success of a character hitting an opponent is based on its dexterity.  If a character's dexterity is greater than its opponent's, the character will always hit.  Otherwise, the success of hitting is random.

The damage inflicted upon hitting is based on the attacker's strength.


Fleeing:
Fleeing is based on dexterity and the distance from the opposing character.  The higher they are, the better the odds the flee will be successful.
