Period 3 Group 5

Isaac Gluck, Rebecca Yuste, Claire Burghard, Angela Lin

Based on "The Fantasy Trip" system, we will implement mainly three stats: IQ, strength (ST), and dexterity (DX). When a character is created, he will be given a ST of 8, dexterity of 8, and 8 extra points that will be divided between the two, based on keyboard input. (NPCs will have these attributes randomly distributed.) 

According to TFT, "players had to roll their dexterity or less on a 3d6 (3 6-faced dice) to hit."
