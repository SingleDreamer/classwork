*Michael, Andrew, Corrin, and Aida.*

## Basic Player Attributes:

**Strength** - The base for how much damage a player does. This is randomly determine between
100 - 200.

**Dexterity** - Will determine the chances of the player running away. Dexterity is between
15 - 20.

**Health** - Players will begin with a randomly determined health between 5000 - 6000 (denoted by MaxH).


##Basic Actions:

**Attack** - How players are going to be either a warrior or an ogre, both of which are not
ranged characters; therefore, we won't have a range system. The minimum damage a player
can do is 50 below its strength and max is 50 above its strength. The damage the player does
each turn is randomly chosen from the range of damage of the player.

**Retreat** - The ability to retreat or escape from an encouter is based on how much health the
player has left and the player's dexterity. To find the chance of retreating, the players dexterity
is added to half the percentage of health left over of the retreating player.
