We will have 3 attributes, Strength, Dexterity, and Intelligence. Each will start at 8, and users will have 8 points to distribute as they please at character creation. There will be 3 classes, the warrior, the rogue, and the mage, who will predominantly use their respective attributes above. There will be no cap on attributes, and on level up the user will gain 1 point in each stat and receive 2 additional points to add to whichever attribute they choose. Enemies will also start at 8 points per attribute and have 2n points randomly distributed upon creation (n being the level of the character).

Combat is turn based, and takes place on a 1 dimensional plane with a distance int representing meters between the player and the opponent; when distance = 0, the 2 occupy the same square, and are duelling. Players can use a turn to move back one meter. Attacks are respectively, swing, shoot bow, and shoot fireball, with the final two being ranged. Players can also flee, which will check the players dexterity vs. the dexterity of the enemy. Other functions may include inventory usage, such as drinking potions, stealing, and use of other miscellaneous spells, such as a healing spell.
