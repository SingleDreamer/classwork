GROUP 6 - SPECIAL K
      Spencer Weiss, Coby Goldberg, Ling Dong, Nadia Saleh, Vincent Wong

//CHARACTER REPRESENTATION
We will have 5 different characters, each with different specialities
   aka. certain attributes will be higher than others in the beginning
They will have dexterity, strength, and defense (and intelligence?), starting at a minimum of 8 each. 8 additional points will vary based on the character.
These characters have different weapons, which they can use depending on whether or not their strength is high enough to use these weapons.

The damage output of the character will be the attack power of the weapon wielded. Similarly, the defense will be the defense-item wielded, which is dependent on whether or not the player has the required defense attribute.

Nothing has been decided as to healing or death
	- maybe the character loses a bit of each attribute upon death?
	- characters could be restored to max health upon the end of a fight

Upon defeat of an opponent, the player will gain attributes depending on the attribute that the opponent specialized in.
     The amount will be a percentage of the player's current attribute(?)

COMBAT
To simulate the three six sided dice, there will be three Random numbers generated, each with a value from 0-5. If the sum of these rolls is less than the player's dexterity, they will hit.
   dexterity will be decreased based on the distance between the two characters
   BUT, we haven't decided on incorporating xy positioning, since...

There will be an explore method, which allows players to randomly come accross enemies.

They will have options of battling, running away (based on dexterity), and talking(?)
