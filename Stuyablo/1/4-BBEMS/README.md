## Gameplay

### Characters

There will be three playable characters - they are:

* Warrior
* Wizard
* Thief

### Character Attributes

* Strength: Warrior and Thief Attack Modifier
* Intelligence: Wizard Attack Modifier
* Dexterity: Hit Rate Chance, as well as who moves first in battle.

Each character starts off with a base attribute spread of 2, broken down as such:

* Warriors (12 Strength, 4 Intelligence, 8 Dexterity)
* Wizards (4 Strength, 12 Intelligence, 8 Dexterity)
* Thieves (8 Strength, 4 Intelligence, 12 Dexterity)

You will then be able to assign 8 extra attribute points to your attributes at the beginning. 

### Experience, Leveling, and other gamplay

Experience: You gain 50 Experience Points from each enemy you kill.

Leveling Up: You level up each 100 Experience Points. Every time you level up you get another 1 Attribute Points to spend.

Fighting: You encounter an enemy. It tells you your stats and your opponents stats including health. You type A to attack. It tells you the results of the battle as well both characters current health and asks you to type A to attack again. Repeat until 1 party has 0 health.

Maximum Health = Strength/Intelligence;

During battle turns, you roll 3 dice. If the value of the 3 dice is less that your dexterity, it's a hit. For each extra coordinates you are away (starting at 1away), you have to roll less than your dexterity minus that number minus one.

ie: If you are at (2,0) and the enemy is at (0,0), and you're dexterity is 11, you have to roll a 10 or lower to get a hit.
